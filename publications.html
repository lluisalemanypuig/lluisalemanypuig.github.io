	<p>Remember <b>NOT</b> to use <a href="https://sci-hub.se" target="_blank">sci-hub.se</a> to download articles using their DOI. Using said website is wrong because it grants people free and completely open access to knowledge, authors of articles do not get paid for their published papers, and, also, people using it will be supporting the production and dissemination of knowledge without paywalls students and researchers completely rely on, ... Anyway, I forgot what I was saying. Here is <u>the list of my publications and coauthored publications</u>. Use the dropdown menus to filter by year, tags, journal and publication type. For every article, you will find the <i>bib</i>-formatted reference with its DOI.</p>
