		<h1>My list of publications</h1>
		
		<p>Almost every publication is freely available at arxiv or other public repository. You will find links to these repositories alongside each reference.</p>
		
		<p>My ORCID id is: <a href="https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3874-991X">0000-0002-3874-991X</a>.</p>
		
		<p>Remember <b>NOT</b> to use <a href="https://sci-hub.st" target="_blank">sci-hub.st</a> to download articles using their DOI. Using said website is wrong because it grants people free and completely open access to knowledge, authors of articles are paid less royalties for their published papers, and, also, people using it will be supporting the production and dissemination of knowledge without paywalls which (obviously!) students and researchers totally need, ... Anyway, I forgot what I was saying. Here is <u>the list of my publications and coauthored publications</u>. Use the dropdown menus to filter by year, tags, journal and publication type. For every article, you will find the <i>bib</i>-formatted reference with its DOI.</p>
