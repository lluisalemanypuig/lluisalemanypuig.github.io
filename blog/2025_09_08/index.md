# First entry!

Welcome to my blog!

In here I'll' try to post stuff I am interested about and projects that I work on.
I don't know how often I will post, nor how regularly I will do so. It might probably be
just a few handful of posts about one of the projects I am trying to optimize and that
will be it. Or maybe I will use this as a motivation to keep working on other projects
and maybe even start new ones. We'll see where this will take me!
