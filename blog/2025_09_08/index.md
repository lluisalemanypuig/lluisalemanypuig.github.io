# First entry!

Welcome to my blog!

In here I will try to post stuff I am interested about and projects that I work on.
I don't know how often I will post, nor how regularly I will do so. It might probably be
just a few handful of posts about one of the projects I am currently trying to optimize
and that will be the end of it. Or maybe I will use this as a motivation to keep working
on other projects and maybe even start new ones. We'll see where this will take me!
